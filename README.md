# FEFU_study

# About 

this is a repository of what i do while studying at FEFU. i do not know what else to write here, because the first sentence fully describes the repository, and now i just want to write something and delay the end of the description in such a ridiculous way. end.

the idea of creating this repository came to my mind after my classmate created a repository - [acceptTheVoid/FEFU-moment](https://github.com/acceptTheVoid/FEFU-moment)
